\#\# Abstract  
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on small datasets is challenging due to overfitting and computational cost. In this study, we explore the use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA-2 models on limited data. Our results demonstrate that LoRA can achieve near full-model performance with less than 5% of trainable parameters, significantly reducing GPU requirements.

\#\# 1\. Introduction  
Large language models such as LLaMA-2 have achieved state-of-the-art performance across natural language understanding tasks. However, adapting them to domain-specific datasets remains computationally expensive. LoRA provides a low-rank parameter adaptation approach, enabling efficient fine-tuning with minimal resources.

\---

\#\# 2\. Methodology  
We fine-tuned LLaMA-2 (7B parameters) on a synthetic dataset of 5,000 sentences. LoRA modules were inserted into the attention layers with rank 8\. Training was performed for 3 epochs using AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4.  

\---

\#\# 3\. Experiments  
Evaluation was conducted on a held-out test set of 1,000 sentences. Metrics included perplexity and BLEU score. LoRA fine-tuning achieved a perplexity of 12.3 and BLEU score of 0.78, compared to 11.8 and 0.80 for full fine-tuning.

\#\# 4\. Discussion  
Our experiments indicate that LoRA significantly reduces training cost while maintaining competitive performance. This approach enables researchers with limited GPU resources to adapt large models efficiently.

\---

\#\# 5\. Conclusion  
LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaMA-2 provides a practical solution for small-dataset adaptation, preserving performance while reducing computational requirements.
